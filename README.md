# Mental Health and Education: Exploring the Connection
## Our Dashboard

URL: [Dashboard](https://dashboard-esm.streamlit.app/)

## Introduction

Mental health and education are two fundamental pillars for the development of individuals and communities. However, these areas are often addressed separately. This analysis aims to explore the connection between them, using representative data from Mexico to answer critical questions:

- How does mental health influence literacy levels?
- Are there generational differences in the willingness to discuss mental health?
- What external factors, such as alcoholism or smoking, could impact literacy?

## Data

To address these questions, data from the ENIGH and ENSANUT surveys of 2018, 2020, and 2022 were analyzed. The data were grouped by generations, based on December 2024:

- **Generation Z:** 10–19 years old.
- **Millennial:** 20–35 years old.
- **Generation X:** 36–51 years old.
- **Baby Boomer:** 52–70 years old.
- **Silent Generation:** 71–91 years old.
- **Greatest Generation:** 92 years and older.

### Key Variables:
- **Literacy** (ENIGH).
- **Mental health indicators**, such as sadness, depression, and suicidal tendencies (ENSANUT).
- **Habits** related to alcoholism and smoking (ENSANUT).

## Results

### Willingness to talk about mental health:
The Silent and Greatest generations (70 years and older) showed a higher proportion of responses indicating sadness or depression compared to younger generations. This contradicts the belief that older adults are more reserved about discussing their mental health.

### Suicide attempts:
Millennials and Generation Z reported slightly higher percentages of suicide attempts. An interactive map highlighted how this trend varied geographically, with an increase in states with high averages of suicide attempts between 2018 and 2022, possibly influenced by the pandemic.

### Impact of alcoholism on literacy:
No direct relationship was found between alcohol consumption habits and literacy levels. Maps showed that states with higher alcohol consumption did not coincide with those with lower literacy levels. In fact, the patterns seemed inverted in terms of visual representation, suggesting that other factors, such as economic resources, might be more relevant.

## Conclusions

- **Willingness to discuss mental health** does not always follow expected generational patterns. Older generations may be more open to talking about these issues than previously thought.
- **Alcoholism and smoking habits** do not appear to be determining factors in literacy but highlight areas of interest for future studies.
- **Differences in literacy levels across generations** reflect progress in access to education but also emphasize the need to address existing gaps in older generations.

This analysis demonstrates that the relationship between mental health and education is more complex than the initial assumptions suggested. While literacy has improved over time, challenges in mental health persist, particularly among younger people. 

This dashboard aims not only to inform but also to raise awareness among decision-makers and the general public about the importance of addressing these issues together. By tackling these challenges, more inclusive and effective policies and programs can be designed to improve both mental health and education in Mexico.
